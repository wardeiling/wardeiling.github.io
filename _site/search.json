My PhD focuses on utilizing causal discovery and machine learning methods to enhance theory formation in the social sciences. Before this, I completed the research master’s program in Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University.\nWhen I am not programming or writing, I enjoy playing the electric guitar, mountain biking, going on hikes and reading philosophy books (about mindfulness and stoicism), as well as novel. Feel free to connect with me on goodreads :)."

We compared the performance of multilevel models (MLMs) and generalized estimating equations (GEEs) across different disaggregation methods. Our simulations show that the commonly used person-mean centering approach—often regarded as the gold standard—can lead to problematic results when applied in MLMs with binary outcomes.

These models are powerful but can easily overfit when applied to the short time series common in psychology. To address this, I implemented and compared three Bayesian approaches that use different types of prior information to stabilize estimation. This project gave me valuable insights into the practical complications of applying Bayesian VAR models and how methodological choices shape the results.

This project illustrated the trade-offs between computational simplicity and statistical rigor, and showed me the practical challenges of handling missing data when many variables are involved."

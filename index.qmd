:::{#hero-heading}


I am a research master's student in methodology and statistics at Utrecht University. I have a specific interest in causal discovery, Bayesian statistics, high dimensional data analysis (e.g., neural networks) and intensive longitudinal data analysis. 

When I am not programming or writing, I enjoy playing the electric guitar, going on hikes and reading philosophy books (about mindfulness and stoicism), as well as novels.

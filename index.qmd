:::{#hero-heading}

I am a PhD student at Tilburg University's [Department of Methodology and Statistics](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/socialsciences/organization/departments/methodology-statistics). My PhD focuses on utilizing causal discovery and machine learning methods to enhance theory formation in the social sciences. Before this, I completed the research master's program in Methodology and Statistics at Utrecht University.

When I am not programming or writing, I enjoy playing the electric guitar, mountain biking, going on hikes and reading philosophy books (about mindfulness and stoicism), as well as novel. Feel free to connect with me on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/149844375-ward) :).
